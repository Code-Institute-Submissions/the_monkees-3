# **The Monkees Project** #

This website has been created as a tribute for the American rock and pop band The Monkees, which was active between 1966 and 1971.

## **UX**

The project started quite ambitious, however whilst designing the home page and doing research for 
the "Online Store" page which was supposed to be included, I have concluded that due to circumstances and lack of experience the best option would be to make a much simpler
website, such as a tribute website and add new features to it as time goes.

## **Technologies/Frameworks Used**

* AWS Cloud9
* Mockups
* Adobe Photoshop
* HTML
* CSS
* BOOTSTRAP
* LIGHTBOX
